### Code review policies
* The Thinkmax code standards and best practices wiki is the main guideline for what a dev lead checks and enforces during code review. The discretion to follow Microsoft best practices lies with the development lead, while adherence to the Thinkmax standards is mandatory and not subject to negotiation. The best place to define this information per initiative is in the DevOps wiki used by the project.
* The dev lead is responsible for defining the Microsoft best practices that will be code reviewed for a given implementation or initiative. The client or stakeholder may also influence these.  For instance a dev lead may not pay attention to code comments but a customer may require them on all classes/methods.
* The developer will submit a code review request to the dev lead via Visual Studio. This creates a shelveset that the dev lead can pull into their workspace to review the project, while not created redundant check-ins to a branch.
    * The code review work items created by the request and response are related to the work item the code review was submitted for.
