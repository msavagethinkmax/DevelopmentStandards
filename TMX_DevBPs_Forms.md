##Forms

####Considerations
* In the vast majority of cases, a pattern should be chosen from the pre-defined list available on the form design. These pre-defined patterns standardize form development and guide the developer to include relevant form controls with appropriate settings for the pattern chosen.  Only in fringe cases where the form design cannot flexibly fit into the pre-defined patterns should the “Custom” pattern be used.
* There will not be many “standards” for form development as the options and permutations available are many  In general when developing forms, keep in mind the user experience and usability of the form. Form navigation should be clean and concise, with controls and grid columns labeled clearly and appropriately.
