### Check-in policies
* A developer cannot check-in pending changes that have not passed code review by the project dev lead or similar level person. Shelvesets can be used to store transient check-ins if needed.
* All changesets must be checked in with a comment referencing the FDD, support case or initiative ID and a short description of what the changeset contains.
    * i.e. FDD-144, initial delivery
    * i.e. FDD-1234, form extension method bug fix
    * i.e. FDD-145, new requirements from CR-123
* All changesets must be checked in against a Azure DevOps work item.
