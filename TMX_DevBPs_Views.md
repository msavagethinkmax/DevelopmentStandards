##Views

####Considerations
<ul>
    <li>Treat view development similar to table development, as a view is just a data structure flattened into a single data soruce</li>
    <li>While not required, it is highly recommended to use AOT query objects to drive the view data sources to make maintenance of a solutions easier.</li>
</ul>

####Naming conventions
<ul>
    <li>View object names should end in "View"</li>
</ul>
